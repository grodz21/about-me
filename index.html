      <h1>Introduction</h1>
	    <p>I'm a game developing college graduate looking forward to learn a new set of skills.  Been living in Michigan for a year now and I like it so far.  Started working as an Avionics Technician at the Detroit Metro Airport performing WiFi installations on Delta Airline's aircrafts.  My objective right now after I finish the Web Developer course is to land a job in the programming or coding field so that I can continue growing and develop myself. The things most important to me are my family, my closest friends and anything related to race cars and car racing.</p>

      <h1>Where I'm from</h1>
      <p>I'm from a small island in the caribbean named Puerto Rico. It has a really nice weather ranging from 70-80 degrees all year round.  There are 270 miles of beach around the island, so there's plenty of spots to choose from to have a nice beach day after work or on your spare time. I think that the best thing of the island is their places to explore. It has so many hidden places to explore that it would take you a good amount of time before you can explore them all.</p>
